# TictactoeApp

Test application: Front end for a tictactoe game. Connects to an api via 
http and websockets.

## Installation

Clone repo, and run "npm install" to install the dependencies.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Run against local api

To run the app vs a local api, the urls in the endpoints service and in the app module need to be updated accordingly.
